            <p>This website serves as my personal portfolio, 
                here you will find a (currently small) collection of work, including school assignments as well as personal projects developed 
                out of curiosity and passion for software development.<br><br>
                
                Currently, the GitHub button is fully functional, showing you a few of my repositories and contributions. 
                However, the LinkedIn button is still in progress and will be added soon. As I currently do not have a proper LinkedIn set up.<br><br>
                
                In addition to my formal studies, I am actively expanding my knowledge by taking courses in Assembly programming 
                and Cyber Security. (I do this through Udemy.) My long-term goal is to build a career in ethical hacking and cybersecurity, where 
                I can apply my skills to protect systems and networks against vulnerabilities.<br><br>
                
                Feel free to explore my projects, and donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or collaboration opportunities!<br><br>
                
                This site is currently still under construction but I shall do my absolute best to show you as much as possible!</p>
